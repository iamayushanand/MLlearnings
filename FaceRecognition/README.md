# Exploring models and strategies for face recognition
These scripts were written to explore the strategies for face recognition. for the face Clustering we get a silhouette of 0.44 with DBscan and PCA on the encodings recieved from the face recognition library. The PCA+SVM approach for face regonition gave a score of 91% on the olivetti dataset from kaggle while the clustering is implemented on the 2k face images dataset from kaggle.
